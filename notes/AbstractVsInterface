1. class: explicitly we need to "abstract" keyword for abstract class, for interface its default "Interface"
2. Abstract Class: both methods having body or not having body is possible
   Interface: by default methods are abstract methods

3.Implementation/Inheritance
Abstract Class: using extends
Interface: using implement

4. Multiple inheritance is not possible with Abstract class but can be possible with Interfaces

5. Class can inherit 1 Abstract class and inherit multiple interfaces in the same class
